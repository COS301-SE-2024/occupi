## Introduction

This document outlines the Python coding standards to ensure consistent,
readable, and maintainable code. Following these standards will help all
contributors write clean, efficient, and bug-free Python code.

## General Code Structure

All code should be clean, readable, and maintainable. Key practices
include:

-   Using meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.

-   Follow consistent indentation with 4 spaces per level.

-   Organize imports at the top of each file, grouping standard library
    imports, third-party imports, and local imports separately.

## PEP 8 Compliance

All Python code must follow the PEP 8 style guide:

-   Line length should not exceed 79 characters.

-   Use spaces around operators (e.g., ‘x = 5‘, not ‘x=5‘).

-   Include a blank line between function definitions and after class
    declarations.

-   Avoid unnecessary blank lines inside functions.

## Error Handling and Logging

Ensure code is resilient and provides meaningful error messages:

-   Use try-except blocks for any potentially unsafe operations.

-   Always log errors using the ‘logging‘ module rather than ‘print‘.

-   Catch specific exceptions, not generic ones (e.g., ‘except
    ValueError‘ instead of ‘except‘).

## Functions and Methods

Functions should be small, focused, and easy to understand:

-   Use descriptive names for functions and methods.

-   Include type hints for function arguments and return values where
    appropriate.

-   Each function should accomplish one specific task.

-   Comment functions and methods with a brief description of what they
    do.

## Code Comments and Documentation

All public functions, classes, and methods must have docstrings:

-   Use multi-line docstrings for functions and classes.

-   Use inline comments sparingly and only when the code is non-obvious.

-   Document any external libraries or APIs used.

-   Write descriptive comments that explain the why, not the how.

## Code Example

Example of a well-documented Python function:

    def get_predictions(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[float]:
        """
        Fetch predictions from the model.

        Args:
            data (dict): Input data for the model.

        Returns:
            list: Model predictions as a list of floats.
        """
        return model.predict(data)

## Testing and Debugging

Ensure that all critical functions are tested and debugged properly:

-   Write unit tests using ‘unittest‘ or ‘pytest‘ for each function.

-   Use mock data where necessary, especially when handling external
    services.

-   Use assertions in tests to validate function outputs.
