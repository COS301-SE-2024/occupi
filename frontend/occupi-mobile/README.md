# Welcome to Occupi-Mobile ðŸ‘‹

//place mobile app renderings here

**NB: This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).**

## Get yourself set up for development

1. We use bun as our package manager. Please download it at <a href="https://bun.sh/docs/installation">bun</a>.
2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. If you want to develop with a simulator, you will need to install <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/">Android Studio</a> for android development or <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/">xcode(only for MacOS)</a> for iOS development. We instead recommend using your own device as the development environment using <a href="https://expo.dev/go">Expo Go</a>
4. Start the app

   ```bash
    bun expo start
   ```
